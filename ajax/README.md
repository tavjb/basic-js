AJAX stands for Asynchronous Javascript And XML
AJAX is essentially a set of technologies that allows us to send and receive data
to a web page in an Asynchronous way

in this context, Asynchronous means that a request for data will not interfere 
with the presentation of the current web page

Even though XML appears in the term AJAX, JSON is actually much more used in AJAX than XML nowadays
